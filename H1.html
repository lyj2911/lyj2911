<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"">
It’s long been recognised that when groups of people come together to solve a problem they can become more than the sum of their parts. The ‘wisdom of the crowd’ has been acknowledged as far back as Ancient Greece, when Aristotle noted that many unremarkable men often make better collective judgments than great individuals.<br>
<br>
Multiple people weighing in on a problem might intuitively seem to lead to a better outcome, but as any manager will tell you, keeping a large team on task is not easy. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) could make harnessing this collective wisdom much easier, making us more effective at our jobs and better able to solve pressing social challenges. Our combined wisdom can also help give a more human element to AI technology, and better guide its decisions.<br>
<br>
“We can have some very smart individuals working on different components in isolation, but if we don't have coordination it's really hard to make any headway,” says Woolley. “I think it's going to be critical to helping these different components actually coordinate in the ways needed to address the biggest collective action problems.”<br>

Our combined wisdom can also help give a more human element to AI technology, and better guide its decisions.</p>
