    <h2>The global obsession with cosy living: Why we're obsessed with cosy living more than ever</h2>
    <p>Our global interest in all things cosy – from fluffy slippers and crackling fires to twinkly lights and indoor jungles – has soared during the pandemic.</p>
    <p>‘Cosiness’ as a concept is anathema to speed – so consumers are, in effect, rushing to slow down. “We believe that evolutionarily, these kinds of settings were advantageous to us as a species,” says Bernheimer. “We evolved to prefer them, and so we still can see our preferences coming out in design trends and real-estate prices.”</p>
    <p>The pandemic has accelerated our obsession with all things cosy – though, as White points out, ‘cosiness’ as a concept is anathema to speed, so consumers are, in effect, rushing to slow down.</p>

    <h2>Why work-life balance isn't a goal</h2>
    <p>Few topics have been so endlessly analysed, glorified and dissected as work-life balance. The quest to attain this somewhat nebulous state has dominated discourse around careers for years – especially for working parents.</p>
    <p>Forget reaching that golden goal: researchers Ioana Lupu of ESSEC Business School in France, and Mayra Ruiz-Castro of the University of Roehampton in the UK argue that work-life balance is a “a cycle, not an achievement”.</p>
    <p>Studies show that personal choices only take you so far in obtaining work-life balance. A lot of it falls on what your organisation does to help make it feasible. Of course, finding that balance probably shouldn’t be something you have to do by yourself.</p>
